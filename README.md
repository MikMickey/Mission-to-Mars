# Mission-to-Mars
Module 10 Web Scraping

#Purpose

## Build an APP to scrape data from websites for our mission to mars projects and then create an HTML page to show our findings.

1. Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter, you’ll scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images.

2. Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Using your Python and HTML skills, you’ll add the code you created in Deliverable 1 to your scraping.py file, update your Mongo database, and modify your index.html file so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.

3. Add Bootstrap 3 Components
Update your web app to make it mobile-responsive, and add two additional Bootstrap 3 components to make it stand out.
